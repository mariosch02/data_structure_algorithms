## Insertion

### How it works

The basic idea of this algorithm is to add a new node into the tree.
However since it is a binary search when the node is inserted it needs to satisfy the properties of the binary search tree.

if the value of the insertion is less than the current node, we insert into the left sub tree.
if the value of the insertion is greater than the current node, we insert into the right sub tree
